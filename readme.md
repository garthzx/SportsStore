## Dependencies

First install node.js on your machine.

After installing node.js, initialize an npm project in the root folder and install http-server package.
```
    npm init
    npm install http-server
```

You'll also need the accompanying ASP.NET Web API 2 (.NET Framework) Project. Will soon add the project here.

## How to run
Press **F5** and it will automatically launch the project and open a browser. Launch config is written in .vscode/launch.json.
